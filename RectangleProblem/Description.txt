Program works on the following ways:
1. First the page loads.
2. After that the user input the data and press the submit button. 
3. Then the rectangle show up with respect to the data given by the user.
3. If any textbox is empty the user will get the message to fill all the box.

Problem occuring:
1. After the postback user sees the rectangle drawn but cannot draw on the same image again.
2. Tried to put the all information in the List Collection of each rectangle but failed.
3. After each postback new image is drawn.
